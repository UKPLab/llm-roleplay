## Installation

Getting Started with UrarTU is a Breeze! üåÄ Simply follow these steps to set up the essential packages and create a local package named 'urartu':

- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:tmynn/urartu.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd urartu`
- Execute the magic command: `pip install .`


Adding a Dash of Convenience! üéâ Once you've executed the previous command, you'll not only have UrarTU ready to roll, but we've also sprinkled in a touch of magic for you ‚ú®. An alias will be conjured, granting you easy access to UrarTU from any directory within your operating system:
```bash
urartu --help
```


> **Note for Usage on Slurm System**
> For an enhanced experience with the Slurm job cancellation process, it is recommended to utilize a specific fork of the `submitit` package available at: [https://github.com/tmynn/submitit](https://github.com/tmynn/submitit). This fork includes the `ResumableSlurmJob.on_job_fail` callback, which allows the incorporation of additional functionality within this callback to ensure a graceful job termination.

## Example Usage

Running an action with UrarTU is as easy as waving a wand. Just provide the name of the configuration file containing the action, followed by the action name itself. ü™Ñ For instance, let's say you want to ignite the `example` action ‚Äì an action that's a bit shy on functionality for now.

Simply execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
urartu action_config=example
```

## Exploring the Experiments
Unveiling Insights with Ease! üîç UrarTU, pairs up with [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim), a remarkable open-source AI metadata tracker designed to be both intuitive and potent. To dive into the wealth of metrics that Aim effortlessly captures, simply follow these steps:
- Navigate to the directory housing the .aim repository.
- Execute the command that sparks the magic:
```bash
aim up
```
Behold as your experiments come to life with clarity and depth! Aim brings your data to the forefront, and with it, the power to make informed decisions and chart new territories in the realm of machine learning. üìà

## Navigating the UrarTU Architecture

Within UrarTU lies a well-organized structure that simplifies your interaction with machine learning components.

### Configs: Tailoring Your Setup

The default configs which shape the way of configs are defined under `urartu/config` directory:
- `urartu/config/main.yaml`: This core configuration file sets the foundation for default settings, covering all available keys within the system.
- `urartu/config/action_config` Directory: A designated space for specific action configurations.


### Crafting Customizations

Tailoring configurations to your needs is a breeze with UrarTU. You have two flexible options:

1. **Custom Config Files**: To simplify configuration adjustments, UrarTU provides a dedicated `configs` directory where you can store personalized configuration files. These files seamlessly integrate with Hydra's search path. The directory structure mirrors that of `urartu/config`. You can define project-specific configurations in specially named files. For instance, an `example.yaml` file within the `configs` directory can house all the configurations specific to your 'example' project, with customized settings.

    - **Personalized User Configs**: To further tailor configurations for individual users, create a directory named `configs_{username}` at the same level as the `configs` directory, where `{username}` represents your operating system username. The beauty of this approach is that there are no additional steps required. Your customizations will smoothly load and override the default configurations, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free experience. ‚ú®

    The order of precedence for configuration overrides is as follows: `urartu/config`, `configs`, `configs_{username}`, giving priority to user-specific configurations.

2. **CLI Approach**: For those who prefer a command-line interface (CLI) approach, UrarTU offers a convenient method. You can enhance your commands with specific key-value pairs directly in the CLI. For example, modifying your working directory path is as simple as:

    ```bash
    urartu action_config=example action_config.workdir=PATH_TO_WORKDIR
    ```

Choose the method that suits your workflow best and enjoy the flexibility UrarTU provides for crafting custom configurations.


### Actions: Shaping Functionality

Central to UrarTU's architecture is the `Action` class. This foundational script governs all actions and their behavior. From loading CLI arguments to orchestrating the `main` function of a chosen action, the `action_name` parameter plays the pivotal role in this functionality.


### Effortless Launch

With UrarTU, launching actions becomes a breeze, offering you two distinctive pathways. üöÄ

- Local Marvel: The first route lets you run jobs on your local machine ‚Äì the very platform where the script takes flight.
- Cluster Voyage: The second option invites you to embark on a journey to the slurm cluster. By setting the `slurm.use_slurm` configuration in `config/main.yaml` which takes boolean values, you can toggle between these options effortlessly.

Experience the freedom to choose your launch adventure, tailored to your needs and aspirations!


And just like that, you're all set to embark on your machine learning journey with UrarTU! üåü
